# medium-scraper
**An article scraper and opener for medium to bypass the article limit for non members**<br/>
Medium limits the number of articles non-members can read to only a few per month. If you are not signed in you can read as many as you want, however you miss out the recommendations tailored to you.
This program signs in and scrapes out your daily recommendations based on your reading history and stores them. Then it opens these in a logged out window so that the number of articles are not limited and you also get to read your recommendations.

**The articles are finally saved as pdf locally and sent via smtp mail service so that it can be accessed from your phone**
